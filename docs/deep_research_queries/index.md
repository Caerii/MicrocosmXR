1. I am curious about getting a literature review with recommended explorations for how to get gAI to strengthen and encourage you to write, making it so that humans are writing a lot of high quality thoughts, and in general havin or tasteful
2. Precedents of multiplayer digital gardens that auto update when each person adds new content and can be shared across platforms.
4. Design an agent system that works only when two separate people are in chat, like a group chat with an agent that buts in. What would the interface be like?
5. Explore the theme of drawing together and co-thinking, regarding an IPad/Remarkable Pro Bridge that integrates Voice chat, sketches, question: how to encourage shared ideation spaces that encourage drawing/amplify stroke-driven thought, and what does the literature and science tell us about this stuff?
6. Curious about whether wearable painting helping robots exists, that can either sketch or paint or draw depending on user intent in real life
7. Help me understand how smart glasses give responses without display feedback
8. Help me understand the state of the art on world models in robotics, XR, and AR and how world state is represented richly in a way that is consistent across humans, devices, and long-term interaction, and how the state of the art in shared memory for massive amounts of information is set up, and how are world models being used across different domains.
9. I have an idea that I want you to explore regarding mixed reality co-location where as you talk, two Quest 3 users in their shared AR space spawn rich objects that might be useful in their conversation, it can also explore searching through YouTube for relevant snippets, obj generation, articles, papers, this notion of “Interactive Shared 3D MindMapping” is quite fascinating to me.

30. Crash course in type script and guide to learning 
31. Recent developments in human factors research 
32. I am curious about getting a literature review with recommended explorations for how to design AI systems and web interfaces to strengthen and encourage you to write, making it so that humans are writing a lot of high quality thoughts, and in general having more tasteful and thoughtful approaches to creating a lot of writing, to allow humans to more effectively work together on book-length content, and also content at even larger scales together, and exploring multiplayer approaches, understanding the existing literature and what inspirations could be had for these ideas.
