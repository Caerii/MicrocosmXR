DEEP RESEARCH QUERY — 1) Career Trajectories in High-Comp Technical Fields (Quant + XR + Job Search Ops)

Role: Act as a research analyst + career strategist for high-comp technical careers. Use web research and cite sources for every non-trivial claim.

Goal: Produce a rigorous, reality-based “pathways map” for:
(A) SWE → elite quantitative finance roles (quant dev / quant researcher / trading infra) targeting $500k+ total comp, including the realistic prevalence of remote work, and
(B) New grad → XR/spatial computing product design roles ($100k+), plus
(C) a compliant job search operations system (tracking + outreach + experimentation), plus
(D) evidence-based resilience strategies for long searches.

Hard constraints:
- Do NOT provide instructions to evade platform anti-spam systems or violate ToS. Focus on ethical, compliant outreach and scalable organization.
- Do NOT rely on rumors or “insider leaks”; flag uncertainty and prefer primary sources.

Deliverables (structured report):
1) Role taxonomy & hiring signals:
   - Quant: quant dev vs quant researcher vs trader vs execution/market microstructure vs low-latency systems; expectations per role.
   - XR: product designer vs spatial UX designer vs prototyper vs technical artist; expectations per role.
2) Competency matrices:
   - Quant: math (prob/stats/linear algebra + when stochastic calc matters), market microstructure, systems, ML, coding (C++/Python/Rust), performance engineering.
   - XR: spatial UX patterns, interaction paradigms (hands/gaze/voice), Unity/Unreal prototyping, perception constraints, design storytelling.
   Include: “minimum viable” vs “differentiators”.
3) Interview process breakdown:
   - For major quant firms and top XR orgs: interview stages, evaluation criteria, typical question families, and what strong artifacts look like.
4) Learning pathways with high-quality resources:
   - A sequenced reading list with tiers:
     Tier A: 10 must-read books/notes/papers
     Tier B: 25–50 core sources
     Tier C: optional deep cuts
   Each entry annotated (1–3 sentences), with ISBN/DOI/links when possible.
5) Economic mechanisms (quant returns):
   - Explain, with citations: stat arb, market making, HFT, volatility arb, alt data. Include limits: capacity, transaction costs, competition, regulation.
6) Case studies:
   - At least 8 concrete transition stories (SWE → quant, and design/adjacent → XR), with timelines, prior background, portfolio/projects, and pivotal moves.
7) Job search ops system (compliant):
   - CRM schema, application tracking fields, outreach templates (non-spam), A/B testing plan, cadence, segmentation, and measurement metrics (reply rate, screen rate).
8) Psychological survival kit:
   - Evidence-based strategies: routine design, rejection resilience, identity/values protection, productivity without burnout.

Evidence requirements:
- Minimum 400 high-quality sources; prioritize peer-reviewed papers/books, reputable industry reports, official firm/platform docs, and credible interviews. 
- Include a “best starting sources” shortlist (100 items) and a “what people get wrong” section. 
- Timestamp: “as of today”.

Output style: detailed, long-form, not a thin blog-style overview.


That's a hefty and well-scoped request—brilliantly precise. To make sure the research lands right, I need a few key clarifications:

For (A) SWE → elite quant roles:

Are you focused on U.S.-based firms only (e.g., Citadel, Jane Street), or should international firms (e.g., Optiver Amsterdam, G-Research UK) be included?

Do you want me to include government-related or academic quant research tracks, or only industry/private sector roles?

For (B) XR roles:

Should this target AR/VR product design primarily within Big Tech (e.g., Meta Reality Labs, Apple Vision Pro), or also startups, gaming studios, or enterprise XR (e.g., industrial training, architecture)?

Any geographic scope preference (U.S., EU, Asia)?

For (C) Job search system:

Do you want the CRM system to be implemented in a specific tool (e.g., Notion, Airtable, Google Sheets), or just a schema with templates and logic?

Should the outreach strategy include cold emails, LinkedIn messaging, alumni intros, or all compliant forms of networking?

For (D) Resilience strategies:

Do you want this grounded in psychology literature (e.g., cognitive behavioral, ACT), productivity research, or both?

Let me know on these points and I’ll get moving on the deep dive.

Response:

for A US based, academmic + industry/private, for B XR roles explore everything systematically anywhere in the world, for C do systematic exploration across everything and good novel tools that are high quality, for D ground it in both and more stuff systematically that makes sense.
